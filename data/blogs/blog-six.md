### Types of UV Rays and Their Effects

The sun emits three types of ultraviolet (UV) rays that affect your skin differently:

- UVA rays: Penetrate deeply, causing premature aging and wrinkles
- UVB rays: Primarily responsible for sunburns and skin reddening
- UVC rays: Mostly blocked by the ozone layer but can be present in artificial sources

### Common Signs of Sun-Damaged Skin

- Sun damage manifests in various ways, including:
- Fine lines and wrinkles, especially around the eyes and mouth
- Dark spots, freckles, and uneven pigmentation
- Rough, leathery skin texture
- Broken capillaries or spider veins
- Loss of skin elasticity
- Dry, scaly patches

### High-Risk Factors and Prevention

Several factors increase your susceptibility to sun damage:

- Fair skin or light-colored eyes
- Living in high-altitude or equatorial regions
- Regular outdoor activities between 10 AM and 4 PM
- Certain medications that increase photosensitivity

Essential prevention strategies include:

- Applying broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30+) daily
- Wearing protective clothing and wide-brimmed hats
- Seeking shade during peak UV hours

- Regular skin examinations for changes

Now that we understand how sun damage occurs and its effects on our skin, let's explore the various medical treatments available to address these concerns.
